<h1>WebAssembly Energy Efficiency Repository</h1>
<p>
    The code contained in this repository is meant to test WebAssembly across Go and Rust programming languages.
    The intent of the functions within is to perform memory and computationally expensive processes in an effort
    to guage energy consumption from their respective execution. This is only a sandbox for local hosting.
</p>
<h2>
    Execution
</h2>
<h3>
    GoLang
</h3>
<p>
    To execute the GUI for GoLang WebAssembly testing purposes, navigate to cmd/server directory. Call 'go run main.go' to
    have the localhost at port 8080 run functionality.
